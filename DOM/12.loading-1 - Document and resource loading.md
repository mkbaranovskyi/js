# Document loading

The lifecycle of an HTML page has 3 important events:

Event|Description
-|-
`DOMContentLoaded`|The browser fully loaded HTML, and the DOM tree is built, but external resources like pictures <img> and stylesheets may be not yet loaded. The handler can lookup DOM nodes, initialize the interface.
`load`|Full loaded, including external resources, **styles** are applied, **image** sizes are known etc.
`beforeunload`|The user is leaving. We can check if the user saved the changes and ask them whether they really want to leave.
`unload`|The user has left, but we still can initiate some operations, such as sending out statistics.
***

## DOMContentLoaded 

Styles don't affect DOM, so DOMContentLoaded usually don't wait for them. But there's an exception: if a `script` goes after a `style`, then the script must wait for the `style` to load (since it may want ot use coordinates, image sizes, etc.). **As DOMContentLoaded waits for scripts, it now waits for styles before them as well.**  

**Autofill** in forms also usually happens after `DOMContentLoaded`.
***


## `window.onunload`

`navigator.sendBeacon(url, data)` can be used to send analytics. 

```javascript
let analyticsData = { /* object with gathered data */ };

window.addEventListener("unload", function() {
  navigator.sendBeacon("/analytics", JSON.stringify(analyticsData));
};
```

* The request is sent as POST.
* We can send not only a string, but also forms and other formats, as described in the chapter Fetch, but usually it’s a stringified object.
* The data is limited by 64kb.
***

We can use `onbeforeunload`: `preventDefault()` to show additional confirmation window before user is gone. 
***

We can check `document.readyState` the learn if the the document is fully loaded:

* `loading` – the document is loading.
* `interactive` – the document was fully read.
* `complete` – the document was fully read and all resources (like images) are loaded too.

```javascript
function work() { /*...*/ }

if (document.readyState == 'loading') {
  // loading yet, wait for the event
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', work);
} else {
  // DOM is ready!
  work();
}
```

Also we can ues `readyStateChange`: 

```javascript
document.addEventListener('readystatechange', () => console.log(document.readyState));
```
***


## Crossorigin policy

Scripts from one site can’t access contents of the other site. So, e.g. a script at https://facebook.com can’t read the user’s mailbox at https://gmail.com.

Or, to be more precise, one origin (domain/port/protocol triplet) can’t access the content from another one. So even if we have a subdomain, or just another port, these are different origins with no access to each other.

To allow cross-origin access, the `<script>` tag needs to have the `crossorigin` attribute, plus the remote server must provide special headers.

```html
<script>
window.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, errorObj) {
  alert(`${message}\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);
};
</script>
<script src="https://cors.javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js"></script>
```

There are three levels of cross-origin access:

* **No** `crossorigin` attribute – access prohibited.
* `crossorigin="anonymous"` – access allowed if the server responds with the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` **with `*` or our origin**. Browser does not send authorization information and cookies to remote server.
* `crossorigin="use-credentials"` – access allowed if the server sends back the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` **with our origin and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.** Browser sends authorization information and cookies to remote server.

Let's add the attribute. If we don’t care about cookies, then `"anonymous"` is the way to go:

```html
<script>
window.onerror = function(message, url, line, col, errorObj) {
  alert(`${message}\n${url}, ${line}:${col}`);
};
</script>
<script src="https://cors.javascript.info/article/onload-onerror/crossorigin/error.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Now, assuming that the server provides an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, everything’s fine.

## Task: preload images

https://javascript.info/onload-onerror#load-images-with-a-callback

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<body>
  <script>
    function preloadImages(sources, callback) {
	  Promise.allSettled(sources.map(src => 
	  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		  const img = document.createElement('img')
		  img.src = src

		  img.onload = resolve
		  img.onerror = reject
	  })))
	  .then(() => callback())
    }

    // ---------- The test ----------

    let sources = [
      "https://en.js.cx/images-load/1.jpg",
      "https://en.js.cx/images-load/2.jpg",
      "https://en.js.cx/images-load/3.jpg"
    ];

    // add random characters to prevent browser caching
    for (let i = 0; i < sources.length; i++) {
      sources[i] += '?' + Math.random();
    }

    // for each image,
    // let's create another img with the same src and check that we have its width immediately
    function testLoaded() {
      let widthSum = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < sources.length; i++) {
        let img = document.createElement('img');
        img.src = sources[i];
        widthSum += img.width;
      }
      alert(widthSum);
    }

    // every image is 100x100, the total width should be 300
    preloadImages(sources, testLoaded);
  </script>
</body>
```
