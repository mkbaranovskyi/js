# Fetch (part 2)

## Download progress

Instead of using `json()` or `text()` methods we can access `ReadablaStream` directly.

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits?per_page=100')

const reader = response.body.getReader()

while(true){
	const { done, value } = await reader.read()

	if(done){
		break
	}

	console.log(`Received ${value.length} bytes`)
}
```

We receive response chunks in the loop, until the loading finishes, that is: until `done` becomes `true`.

* `done` – true when the reading is complete, otherwise false.
* `value` – a typed array of bytes: Uint8Array.

Full example: 

```javascript
// 1. fetch and obtain the reader, write down the total length.

const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/commits?per_page=100`)
console.log("Response: ", response)
const reader = response.body.getReader()

const contentLength = +response.headers.get('Content-Length')
let receivedLength = 0
let chunks = []

// 2. Get the data chunk by chunk.

while(true){
	const { done, value } = await reader.read()
	if(done){
		break
	}

	chunks.push(value)
	receivedLength += value.length

	console.log(`Received ${receivedLength} bytes of ${contentLength}`)
}

console.log("Chunks: ", chunks)

// 3. Concatenate chunks together.

// if we need Blob, we can just do `let blob = new Blob(chunks)` instead of the following

const chunksAll = new Uint8Array(receivedLength)
let position = 0
for(const chunk of chunks){
	chunksAll.set(chunk, position)
	position += chunk.length
}

// 4. Decode into a string
let result = new TextDecoder('utf-8').decode(chunksAll)

let commits = JSON.parse(result)
console.log("Commits: ", commits)
```

## Abort

We can use the `AbortController` object to abort any async tasks, including `fetch` requests.

```javascript
let controller = new AbortController()
```

![](img/2020-01-15-14-15-31.png)

It has a property `signal` (containing an object) and an `abort()` method from the prototype. We can set a listener on `signel` to track it.

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController()	// AbortController instance

controller.signal.addEventListener('abort', () => alert('Aborted'))

controller.abort()	// <--- here `fetch` gets an event from `signal`and aborts the request
console.log(controller.signal)	// AbortSignal instance
```

![](img/2020-01-15-14-33-29.png)

When the `fetch` request is initiated, we pass in the `AbortSignal` as an option inside the request's options object. **This associates the signal and controller with the `fetch` request** and allows us to abort it by calling `AbortController.abort()`. When a `fetch` is aborted, its promise rejects with an error `AbortError`.

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController()

setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 1000)

const response = fetch(`https://example.com`, {
	signal: controller.signal	// we bind the controller to this `fetch`
})
.then(result => console.log(result))
.catch(err => console.warn(err.message))
```

`AbortController` can also be called for multiple requests

```javascript
const urls = ['https://learn.javascript.ru//article/promise-chaining/one.js', 'https://learn.javascript.ru//article/promise-chaining/two.js', 'https://learn.javascript.ru//article/promise-chaining/three.js']

const controller = new AbortController()

const responses = urls.map(url => fetch(url, {
	signal: controller.signal
}))

const results = await Promise.all(responses)

controller.abort()	// aborts all the fetches
```
***


## Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (cors)

https://javascript.info/fetch-api

Origin is `https://example.com` (not the full address `https://example.com/user/page`).

A request for a resource (like an image or a font) outside of the origin is known as a **cross-origin request**. The server only answers to these if it's explicitly set to allows them from the current origin (or from any). In this case the server sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://client.com` (or `*`) header in the response. 

Implementing the request headers to set up CORS correctly depends on the language and framework of the backend.

For example, if you are using Node, you can use setHeader(), as shown below:

```javascript
response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
```

If you are using Express, you can use CORS middleware:
```
npm install cors
```

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var cors = require('cors');
var app = express();

app.use(cors());

app.get('/hello/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.json({msg: 'Hello world, we are CORS-enabled!'});
});

app.listen(80, function () {
  console.log('CORS-enabled web server is listening on port 80');
});
```
***


## Mode

The mode option is a safe-guard that prevents occasional cross-origin requests:

```javascript
fetch(url , {
	...
	mode: cors,
	...
})
```

* "`cors`" – the default, cross-origin requests are allowed.
* "`same-origin`" – cross-origin requests are forbidden.
* "`no-cors`" – only simple cross-origin requests are allowed.
***


## Credentials

The credentials option specifies whether fetch should send cookies and HTTP-Authorization headers with the request.

* `"same-origin"` – the default, don’t send for cross-origin requests,
* `"include"` – always send, requires Accept-Control-Allow-Credentials from cross-origin server in order for JavaScript to access the response, that was covered in the chapter Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests,
* `"omit"` – never send, even for same-origin requests.
***


## URL object

A built-in object that has some nice features for easy access of the different parts of an url. We can pass URL objects to networking (and most other) methods instead of a string

```javascript
const url = new URL('https://example.com/page')

console.log(url)
```

![](img/2020-01-16-14-30-50.png)

The cheatsheet for URL components: 

![](img/2020-01-16-14-31-30.png)

* href is the full url, same as url.toString()
* protocol ends with the colon character :
* search – a string of parameters, starts with the question mark ?
* hash starts with the hash character #
* there may be also user and password properties if HTTP authentication is present: http://login:password@site.com (not painted above, rarely used).
***


## Search Params

![](img/2020-01-19-16-22-21.png)

```javascript
const url = new URL('https://google.com/search')

url.searchParams.append('q', "грустный котик")	// the query is encoded automatically

console.log(url.toString())	// https://google.com/search?q=%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9+%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA
```
***


## Encoding strings

If we use regular strings, we should use `encodeURIComponent` - it encodes all forbidden for URLs characters plus escapes `#, $, &, +, ,, /, :, ;, =, ?, @` that are allowed in the URLs in general but we need to use them as a part of the search query not affecting the URL itself. 

```javascript
let music = encodeURIComponent('Rock&Roll')	// we encode the `&` symbol

let url = `https://google.com/search?q=${music}`

console.log(url)	// https://google.com/search?q=Rock%26Roll
```

`EncodeURI` function only encodes the symbols that are totally forbidden in URLs (means the set of symbols above is not encoded).
