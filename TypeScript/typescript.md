# TypeScript

- [TypeScript](#typescript)

***

Install:

```bash
sudo npm i -g typescript
```

Create a file: `script.ts`. Then **compile** it into the regular JS: 

```bash
# once
tsc script.ts

# in watch mode
tsc script.ts -w
```

**Remember**: you only include **JS** files in your app. And you only use **TS** for development, JS is generated from it automatically.
